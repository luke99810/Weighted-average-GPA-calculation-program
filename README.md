Program Function：
This program calculates the average credit point (GPA) for students and generates a new Excel file containing the results. The program reads an Excel file containing student grades, parses the course names and credits, converts the grades to points, and finally calculates the average credit point for each student.
Usage：
1.Input File Path: The user needs to input the full path of the Excel file containing student grades.Input Output File Name: The user needs to input the file name for the generated results (e.g., GPA_Calculation_Results.xlsx).
2.Program Execution: The program will automatically read the input file, calculate the average credit point for each student, and save the results to the specified output file.
Program Features：
  Generality: The program works with any Excel file containing student grades and credits, as long as the column names are in the format Course ID - Course Name - Credits.
  Systematicity: The program automatically parses course names and credits, converts grades to points, and calculates the weighted average.
  Operability: The program provides a simple user interface where the user only needs to input the file path and output file name to complete the operation.
  Adaptability: The program can handle different grade formats (such as percentage-based and grade-based) and convert them to corresponding points.
  Innovativeness: The program combines various GPA calculation rules and supports custom point conversion methods.
  Verifiability: The program outputs detailed calculation results, allowing users to verify the accuracy of the results.
Example：
Assuming the input file is named 2023_Sophomore_Up_GPA_Details.xlsx, running the program will generate a file named GPA_Calculation_Results.xlsx, which contains each student's name, class, and calculated average credit point.
Hope this project can help some university students to calculate their GPA.
